<h2> Write one paragraph on why disagreement is beneficial when solving complex cases or problems.</h2>

 <p> Disagreement is beneficial because it can actually make a group's work better and it can be beneficial because it forces you to look at things from different angles. 
    This enriches the scope of a solution. Having disagreements creates trust within the group. 
    Reaching this point of honesty in voicing your own idea despite the popular consensus shows the level of trust and confidence you have to your group which makes group work better.
